# day 1

Today I found my data on www.CBS.nl. I downloaded the data in CSV format and spent some time putting everything in the right place (columns, rows, different variables, etc.).). After this I used a function that I wrote (convertCSV2JSON.py) to convert the data to JSON data. 


# day 2

Once the data was fully usable, I was able to start with the first figure: the bar chart. I finished my code for a bar chart that uses data from one province and one year, and yet have to find out how to program the bar chart in such a way that the user is able to switch between the different years (2010/2015) and the different provinces. This is something I planned on asking tomorrow.

Another problem I encountered today was that the browser would not load my data in the right way. After asking a staff member for help, we found some minor detail in my javascript file caused the error. This was solved quickly.
