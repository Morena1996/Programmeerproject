# day 1

Today I found my data on www.CBS.nl. I downloaded the data in CSV format and spent some time putting everything in the right place (columns, rows, different variables, etc.).). After this I used a function that I wrote (convertCSV2JSON.py) to convert the data to JSON data. 


# day 2

Once the data was fully usable, I was able to start with the first figure: the bar chart. I finished my code for a bar chart that uses data from one province and one year, and yet have to find out how to program the bar chart in such a way that the user is able to switch between the different years (2010/2015) and the different provinces. This is something I planned on asking tomorrow.

Another problem I encountered today was that the browser would not load my data in the right way. After asking a staff member for help, we found some minor detail in my javascript file caused the error. This was solved quickly. 


# day 3

Today I finished the second view: the fill gauge. I had problems with positioning the gauge, but besides that, it was rather easily done by using an example. 


# day 4

Today my plan was to make the third view: the map. Due to the huge chaos on Science Park (the roof was blown off) and the fact that I couldn't ask any questions all day, I was not able to finish this one. I assume that this won't affect my grade, considering the very exceptional circumstances. Another thing I was not able to ask was how to combine all views in one webpage, so this is also something I'll have to put off until Monday.
